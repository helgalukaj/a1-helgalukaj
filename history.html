			<h1>Music history</h1>
<p>In 1700s, in Italy was created a new genre such as classical music. 
This drew the attention of all people of the world who loved the compositions of Niccolo Piccinni and Giuseppe Domenico Scarlatti.
At the end of 1500s, Florence became the home of Italian opera. 
That is why the best opera houses “La Scala” and  “San Carlo Theater” were built there back in 1700s.
The most dominant composer was Giuseppe Verdi. 
His masterpiece “Aida” shows us that opera became more solemn and glamorous in 1800s.</p>
